# Matcha üî•

_Matcha_ is a full-stack dating app made with ReactJS, Redux, Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL & Tailwind CSS. It was the second project of web branch at Hive Helsinki, done as a group project with two schoolmates of mine - [Juho Kangas](https://github.com/JuhoKangas) and [Alba Casta√±o](https://github.com/acastanome). We didn't have previous experience with the mentioned stack and we learned everything by doing. Building this app took us two months, during which we not only improved our coding skills, but also our teamwork skills, prioritizing tasks and organizing work efficiently to meet a set deadline. <br />

### Registration and Signing-in
User can register providing an email address, a username, a last name, a first name and a password that is encrypted in the database. After the registration, an e-mail with an unique link is sent to the registered user to verify their account. The user can then connect with their username and password. They can request password reinitialization if they forget it via a unique link sent in an email to them.
